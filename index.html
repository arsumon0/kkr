    <h2>Captain Address</h2>
    <p><B>Shreyas Iyer</B>: "Absolutely comprehensive to be honest. This is what we demanded from the team and every
        individual. They stood out to the occasion. It is hard to express. The wait was longer than the match. We played
        like Invincibles throughout the season.



        <br>The performance has been flawless throughout. I am running out of words. We've been tremendous from game 1,
        stepped up today. All we demanded to back each other. This could have gone either way. We were lucky enough to
        bowl first. Every situation went in our favor. Thanks to SRH, they were phenomenal.
    </p>

    <p><B>Pat Cummins</B>: "I thought they bowled fantastically. Fortunately, old mate Starcy turned it on again. Yeah,
        obviously it wasn't enough tonight. Totally outplayed.



        <br>You know, you hope to hit a few boundaries early and get into the game, but they bowled fantastically well
        and didnâ€™t give us anything. It was similar last weekend in Ahmedabad; they bowled really well. So, yeah, full
        credit to them.
    </p>
